# Changes since fork
1. A folder is now passed to the program instead of a file - this allows user to analyse conversations that have been split into multiple files in the export, as well as to analyse multiple conversations at once if the root folder with specific conversation subfolder is provided.

2. Extra stats about conversations added: which participant wrote how many messages, initiated how many new conversations etc
